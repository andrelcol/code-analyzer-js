# **Code Analyzer JS**

**Code Analyzer JS** is a Visual Studio Code extension that analyzes and suggests optimizations for JavaScript code. It identifies patterns such as redundant loops and recommends more efficient alternatives, like using higher-order functions (`map`, `filter`). The extension also comments the original code to preserve it.

---

## **Features**

- Detects `for` loops and recommends replacements with higher-order functions.
- Automatically comments the old code and inserts the optimized version.
- Integrates with the VS Code problems panel to display optimization suggestions.
- Easy to use, with commands triggered directly from the editor.

### **Example Usage**

Original Code:
```javascript
const result = [];
for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    if (array[i] % 2 === 0) {
        result.push(array[i]);
    }
}
```

After analysis:
```javascript
// const result = [];
// for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
//     if (array[i] % 2 === 0) {
//         result.push(array[i]);
//     }
// }
array.filter(x => x % 2);
```
